### Harassment and Discrimination

-   Our research group and department must be free from harassment and discrimination. All lab members must adhere to the LMU's policies on discrimination and harassment, which you can and must read [here](https://www.lmu.de/de/die-lmu/arbeiten-an-der-lmu/zusaetzliche-angebote/diversity/antidiskriminierung/).
-   We are committed to a safe, friendly, and inclusive environment for everyone. We do not tolerate verbal or physical harassment or discrimination based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We also do not tolerate intimidation, stalking, unwanted photography or video recording, sustained disruptions, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Lewd language and behavior are unacceptable in the lab and at any lab events.
-   If you experience or witness harassment, report it to Lucia, Gerrit and Frank immediately. If one of us is involved, contact the department's director or the [LMU's contact point](https://www.lmu.de/de/die-lmu/arbeiten-an-der-lmu/zusaetzliche-angebote/diversity/antidiskriminierung/anlaufstellen-fuer-studierende/).

### **Work/life balance**

-   We aim to promote sustainable creativity and productivity for all of our members, which can’t be achieved without a healthy balance between work and personal life.
-   No lab member is expected to work in ways that interfere with a healthy life. Work should not be so excessive as to interfere with sleep, exercise, or family/personal time.
-   Lab members are expected to be proactive regarding deadlines, to avoid last-minute scrambles. We may decline to support submissions that are prepared with insufficient lead time.
-   We aim to promote an environment that is understanding and supportive of individuals with child care and adult care responsibilities. This includes but is not limited to offering flexible work hours to help individuals with familial responsibilities.
-   The lab is committed to fully supporting individuals with chronic physical and/or mental illnesses, as well as individuals with accessibility needs. No lab member will be discriminated against because of their chronic diagnosis or health-related limitations of their ability to work. Lab members are encouraged to prioritize their physical and mental health as much as possible, and the lab is prepared to support them in doing so.
-   Lab members who are seeking time off for health (including mental health) reasons are strongly encouraged, though absolutely not required, to speak with us about their concerns. We commit to approaching these conversations in a nonjudgmental and empathetic manner, and to working with all lab members to find a solution that works best for them.

### Taking Photos & Videos

-   Respect the privacy and comfort of lab members by obtaining explicit consent before taking photos or videos, especially in situations where they might not be aware (e.g. during MRI scans). Always get consent before posting any images on social media. This ensures everyone feels comfortable and respected.
-   Do not photograph participants during experiments without IRB approval. If you need a demonstration photo or video, ask a group member if they are comfortable being photographed.

### Scientific Integrity

#### Research (Mis)conduct

-   Our research group and department are committed to research integrity and will not tolerate fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism. Please read the LMU's policies on good scientific practice [here](https://cms-cdn.lmu.de/media/contenthub/amtliche-veroeffentlichungen/gwp-ordnung.pdf).
-   If you feel pressured to succeed, talk to your supervisor. Remember, the goal of science is to arrive at the truth. Misconduct not only disservices you and the field but also risks your career. It is never justified.

#### Reproducible Research

-   Reproducible research is essential. Others should be able to reproduce your results exactly using your raw data. Document each step of your analysis pipeline thoroughly, including pre-processing, model runs, and statistical tests. Comment your code clearly so it’s understandable to others, and use version control (e.g., Git and GitHub) to track changes.
-   Reproducibility is linked to replicability: your results should be consistent when the study is repeated with different data sets. Our goal is to produce research that is both reproducible and replicable.

#### Authorship

The [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/resource/blob/173732/4166759430af8dc2256f0fa54e009f03/kodex-gwp-data.pdf) defines an authorship as follows:

"Autorin oder Autor ist, wer einen genuinen, nachvollziehbaren Beitrag zu dem Inhalt einer wissenschaftlichen Text-, Daten- oder Softwarepublikation geleistet hat. Alle Autorinnen und Autoren stimmen der finalen Fassung des Werks, das publiziert werden soll, zu. Sie tragen für die Publikation die gemeinsame Verantwortung, es sei denn, es wird explizit anders ausgewiesen. Autorinnen und Autoren achten darauf und wirken, soweit möglich, darauf hin, dass ihre Forschungsbeiträge von den Verlagen beziehungsweise den Infrastrukturanbietern so gekennzeichnet werden, dass sie von Nutzerinnen und Nutzern korrekt zitiert werden können. (An author is someone who has made a genuine, identifiable contribution to the content of a scientific text, data, or software publication. All authors agree to the final version of the work to be published. They share joint responsibility for the publication unless explicitly stated otherwise. Authors ensure, as far as possible, that their research contributions are labeled by publishers or infrastructure providers in a way that allows users to cite them correctly.)"

For new projects, the lead student or post-doc is typically the first author. The direct supervisor (e.g. Lucia, Gerrit, Daniel or Frank) will usually be the last author. Contributions from other students or post-docs will determine their placement on the author list. If a project is handed off, the new lead may take first authorship unless co-first-authorship is appropriate. These issues will be discussed openly, and you should feel free to discuss authorship status if uncertain.

#### Old Projects

If a dataset remains unanalyzed or unwritten three years after data collection ends, we will reassign the project to expedite publication. If a student or post-doc voluntarily relinquishes their rights before the three-year mark, the project will also be reassigned. This policy ensures valuable data, especially costly data like fMRI, gets published, prioritizing the original data collector.
