### Getting to know the team

#### Group lead

Our group is led by Lucia Bulubas, Gerrit Burkhardt and Frank Padberg.

-   Frank <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7638-8310"> <img src="https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orcid_16x16.png" alt="ORCID logo" width="16" height="16"/></a> has founded the research group. He is a consultant psychiatrist and in charge of HR at our department. Besides brain stimulation, he also is co-lead of the psychotherapy research group and is in charge of the ward B1b which offers a specialized psychotherapy program for the treatment of patients with chronic depression (CBASP).

Within our group he is responsible for conducting randomized controlled treatment trials using optimized study designs (Patient-centered Translational Trials \[PACTT\] unit). He also specializes on new approaches for depression measurement like digital phenotyping, treatment stratification and personalization, and meta-analytic research.
-   Lucia <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5797-8742"> <img src="https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orcid_16x16.png" alt="ORCID logo" width="16" height="16"/></a> is a medical doctor and in charge of our clinical brain stimulation service ([Stimulationsambulanz](https://www.lmu-klinikum.de/psychiatrie-und-psychotherapie/patientenportal/ambulanzen/stimulationsambulanz/1cd11fcfdff07bfd)), in which we offer in- and out-patient treatment with rTMS and tDCS for patients with depression and schizophrenia. She also specializes on MR-informed neurostimulation approaches with the goal to optimized treatment outcomes via individualized dosage parameters. Moreover, she is currently on of the speakers of the Early Career Scientists of the [DZPG](https://www.dzpg.org) for the Munich-Augsburg site.

For our projects, we closely cooperate with Daniel Keeser <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0244-1024"> <img src="https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orcid_16x16.png" alt="ORCID logo" width="16" height="16"/></a> who leads the research group [Neuromodulation And Multimodal NeuroImaging](https://neuroimaging-munich.de/tdcs/home.html) and is on the executive board of the [Neuroimaging Core Unit Munich (NICUM)](https://www.en.nicum.uni-muenchen.de/index.html).

#### Full-time members

### Getting around the lab

Our lab is situated at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, LMU University Hospital, Nußbaumstr.
7, 80336 München.

-   **Main Workspace**: The primary working area for core lab members is in the "Altbau" (Building A), 1st floor, room A1.45. Due to the limited availability of space, we encourage collaboration in managing the workspace. Please coordinate with existing lab members to ensure you are appropriately set up.
-   **Study Coordination Office**: Adjacent to the main workspace is the study coordination office (A1.46), primarily used for study visits.
-   **Brain Stimulation Treatment and Experiment Rooms**: These are located on the ground floor (Rooms A…, A…). Room availability and booking are managed via an Outlook calendar.
-   **Frank's Office**: Frank's office is located on the 4th floor of the building.
-   **MRI Scanner**: The department's MRI scanner is housed in the NICUM on the ground floor.

#### Housekeeping

-   Due to the presence of sensitive patient data, all rooms must remain locked at all times. You can obtain access through either a group transponder, available to group members at the main reception ("Pforte"), or if you plan to work with us for a year or more, you may request a personal transponder following approval.
-   Please take a moment to introduce yourself to the reception team ("Pförtner"). They are usually very helpful, well-informed about the department's organizational matters, and appreciate knowing who passes by each day.
-   Please ensure that windows are closed, and doors are locked when leaving any office space.
-   You are welcome to use the lab refrigerator, sink, and dishware. However, please ensure you also contribute to cleaning up, including washing any used items, and be mindful not to leave food in the fridge for too long...

#### Lab communication

Aside from face-to-face interactions, our main form of daily communication is email.
Additionally, we have a non-mandatory, informal WhatsApp group that you are welcome to join (ask the other lab members to invite you).
However, please check with other lab members before contacting them on their personal numbers for work-related matters and be mindful of their privacy.

#### Wifi

Although Wi-Fi reception in the old building can be inconsistent, you should generally be able to connect to either [Eduroam](https://www.lmu.de/de/die-lmu/struktur/zentrale-universitaetsverwaltung/informations-und-kommunikationstechnik-dezernat-vi/it-servicedesk/zentrale-it-angebote/wlan-eduroam/) or [Bayern Wlan](https://www.wlan-bayern.de/#/).

#### IT services

As a researcher at the LMU you have free access to several IT services via your LMU User ID (LMU-Benutzerkennung).
This includes Microsoft Office, Zoom, Affinity and Adobe products.
You can find a full list [here](https://www.lmu.de/en/about-lmu/structure/central-university-administration/it-services-division-vi/it-service-desk/central-it-services/).

If you are actively involved in patient care (e.g. TMS treatments), we will also set you up with a helios-Account, which gives you access to the secure medical network of the hospital.
This also includes an own e-mail address (name\@med.uni-muenchen.de), access to our Outlook calenders and to shared folders (PSY-GCBS).

If you would like to work with pseudonymized research data (e.g., statistical analyses, visualizations), please use our RStudio server, which can be accessed remotely via VPN client.
If you require an account, please contact Gerrit by email.

#### Research infrastructure & information

Check out the [Forschungsportal (science portal)](https://forschungsportal.med.lmu.de) of the Medical Faculty for information on current events, core facilities, funding opportunities, digital services and much more.

### Getting started with your research career

#### Setting up your (online) research profile

-   Make sure to register for an Open Researcher and Contributor ID ([ORCID](https://orcid.org/)).[^1]
-   Think about setting up a profile on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net) which is a European commercial social[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking)networking site for scientists and researchers to share papers, ask and answer questions, and find collaborators.

[^1]: Your ORCID is an unique and persistent identifier that you yourself connect with your professional (scientific) information.
    This helps to recognize all your work, even if e.g., you change your name, one of your coauthors misspells it, or you move on to a new institution.
    Getting an ORCID is free and quick and meanwhile, several platforms, from grant application to manuscript submission and beyond, allow you to use your ORCID to log into their system.
    Note however, that this is a self-maintained identifier.
    It thus is only as up-to-date as you keep it.

#### Keeping up with the literature

With the constant stream of new research being published, it can be challenging to stay up-to-date.
Here are some effective strategies to help you keep pace:

-   Use an RSS feed or subscribe to journal table of contents.
-   Make sure to get alerts for preprints, too (e.g., neuroscience-tagged papers on bioRxiv).
-   Do periodic searches on Google Scholar or Pubmed, and sort the results by date. Browse article titles for relevant ones, read the abstract to see how relevant it is, and read the paper in full if it is important for your work or if you find it interesting.
-   Register for a Google Scholar profile. Google will alert you when relevant research is published, given your publications and the papers you cite, and will also alert you when someone cites you.
-   Share papers with other lab members (e.g. using our WhatsApp group)
-   Keep track of all the great ideas you have as you read! E.g. by using something like OneNote/Notes to organize your thoughts and questions.
-   Organize your references and create bibliographies with a citation management tool like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/), which is free and has a lot of useful features. You can get started with Zotero by checking out this [introductory course offered by the LMU Open Science Center](https://lmu-osc.github.io/introduction-to-zotero/).
-   If a publication is hidden behind a paywall
    -   check if you have access via the [LMU university library](https://login.emedien.ub.uni-muenchen.de/login)
    -   contact the authors on ResearchGate and request the manuscript
